# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Swift**

## Project: **Freedom Project**

---

### 9/30/25:
* Looking at the swift documentation, I downloaded Swift and VS50 code
* Looked at the [swift documentation](https://www.swift.org/documentation/) and see how it's written and utilized
* I then created a file and named it myProject.swift with the `.swift` being extremely important for the file to run
* As I initiated everything, I started with a string of code to see how it worked.

* For my first code, I wanted a simple print and so I typed in `print("Hello World");`
* I also tried using different strings and concatenations

* I also declared variables and used those to combine with other to create longer texts
* As they both fundementally are the same but take on different approaches, it felt familiar but also different

* `var greet = "Hello World"`
* `var time = ",morning!"`
* `print(greet + time)`
* That print would result in "Hello World, morning!"

* For next week I plan to watch some videos and look more through the documentation to learn more about swift
